                        questionAnswer={`I would love to use the rest of the Fall semester (& the winter break) to begin reaching out to local bosses who would be willing to share their story and career insight with students in the Spring semester. If students have any individuals in mind, or companies they would like to hear from, I want to start a running list of potentials bosses we can start inviting. I would like to coordinate with the Career Center, and other campus resources to ensure students have a wide range of professions and bosses with whom they can share a quick meal.`}

                        question='What motived you to run for the spirit of the roadrunner?'
                        questionAnswer='Fun fact: I really wanted to be Rowdy the Roadrunner Mascot, but I missed the audition :(. When I heard the applications for Spirit of the Roadrunner opened I thought this would be another great way to spread UTSA Pride and make an impact. Through my platform "Breakfast with the Boss," I believe that opening that line of communication with individuals, who have walked the bumpy path to success, would be a great way to uphold our Roadrunner creed and introduce students to explore paths they might not have considered.'
